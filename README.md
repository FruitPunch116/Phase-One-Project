# Bank Website Simulation

This project aims to replicate a Bank company's website for educational purposes. It is an ongoing project with multiple phases, intended to enhance developer programming logic and knowledge over time.

## Project Description

The Bank Website Simulation project is a web application that simulates the functionalities of a bank website. It provides users with an interactive interface to explore and interact with banking-related features. This project serves as a learning tool for developers to improve their skills and understanding of web development concepts.

## Phases

The project will be developed in multiple phases, each adding new features and enhancements to increase the potential and functionality of the website. The phases will be planned and executed based on the evolving requirements and the learning goals of the developers involved.

## Non-Profit Project

This project is a non-profit initiative aimed at providing a practical learning experience for developers. As a non-profit project, the website's content will not be published online and will remain local. Due to the absence of a real backend, the website will consist of a single page only, without landing pages or extensive backend integration.

## Deliverables

The main deliverables for the current phase of the project, taking into account the developers' knowledge, are as follows:

- Create a fully functional website.
- Render content in the DOM extracted from the API.
- Implement at least three different types of event listeners.
- Ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience during the project showcase.

## Requirements

To achieve the project goals, the following requirements have been identified:

- Develop a website with an intuitive user interface.
- Retrieve and render data from the API within the DOM.
- Implement various event listeners to enable user interactions.
- Focus on providing a great user experience throughout the project showcase.

## User Experience

During the project showcase, users should be able to:

- Navigate through menus and tables.
- Access relevant content as needed.
- Provide feedback to improve the usefulness of the website.
- View account information and details for pre-set users by providing login information. If no login information is provided, the page will not load.

## Technical Details

The Bank Website Simulation project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes APIs to retrieve data and interacts with the DOM to dynamically display information to users.
